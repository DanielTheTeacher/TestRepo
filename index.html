    <!-- Application Structure Plan: 
        The SPA is structured with a fixed top navigation bar.
        Key Changes from v6:
        - Norwegian cheating section made briefer, clarified inspiration, internal citations removed.
        - Specific school references (Hadeland, Askøy, Trøndelag) removed from main reference list.
        - Reference list consolidated: duplicate URLs now share single citation numbers.
        - Empty reference [8] removed.
        - All other content and structure remains consistent with v6.
        This thematic, non-linear structure is chosen over a direct module-by-module translation to make the content more engaging and allow students to explore topics based on interest, facilitating better understanding and retention for the target audience (VG1 vocational students). Key interactions include quizzes, clickable reveals, and now clearly defined writing prompts.

An AI might give you an answer in perfect Norwegian, claiming these are "Norwegian electrical safety standards." But, if the AI was mostly trained on American data, it might actually be giving you US electrical codes, just translated. Following these could be extremely dangerous in Norway, as safety standards differ, potentially leading to accidents, equipment damage, or even electrocution. The AI <em>sounds</em> correct, but it's dangerously wrong for your specific location and rules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Getting Skipped for an Opportunity (And No One Knows Why):</strong> Let's say in a few years you apply for a summer job or a special program. The company uses AI to sort through applications. Your application might get skipped. It could be that the AI was poorly designed to promote diversity and ended up accidentally filtering *out* male applicants for certain roles, or it might unfairly filter out female candidates for technical roles if it learned from historical data where mostly men held those positions. Or it might be looking for tiny, weird patterns in CVs that it <em>thinks</em> predict success, but actually have nothing to do with how good you'd be, accidentally discriminating against you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Media Misunderstandings & Shadow Bans:</strong> You post something online – a joke, an opinion, a comment. An AI moderator, trained mostly on English internet drama or American cultural issues, might misunderstand your Norwegian slang, sarcasm, or cultural reference. It could flag your normal comment as "problematic," delete it, or even temporarily ban your account ("shadow ban" you so fewer people see your stuff) because it wrongly thinks you're breaking rules, even when you're just talking like a typical Norwegian teen.</li>

                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    Sometimes AI can generate incorrect or misleading information presented as fact (AI hallucinations).<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2">[2]</a></sup> This is called <span class="tooltip">AI hallucinations<span class="tooltiptext">When AI invents facts or information that isn't true.</span></span>.

                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    <strong>Why does this happen?</strong> AI hallucinations occur because AI doesn't 'know' but predicts based on patterns.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Think of it like a super-advanced autocomplete. If you ask it, 'Who will win the Ballon d'Or in 2025?', it doesn't know the answer. But it knows which football players' names often appear near 'Ballon d'Or winner'. So, it might confidently name a famous current player. It <em>sounds</em> believable because the name is right, the context is right, but the AI is just making a highly probable guess, not stating a known fact. It can be totally wrong.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    This isn't deliberate deception by the AI. It's just how it works: predicting patterns. If the patterns in its data are incomplete or lead to a 'likely' but false statement, it will still generate it.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-4">
                    For example, an AI might 'invent' historical events or scientific 'facts.' The problem is made worse because AI can make its output look very real and professional (what I, Daniel the teacher, like to call 'the look of expertise'). Perfect grammar and a confident tone can make false information seem true, even when it's completely made up.

                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    When you use AI for school, the most important rule is: <strong>You First!</strong> This means you must always start by using your own brain – your own thinking, planning, and initial effort – <em>before</em> you turn to AI.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    Think of it this way: using AI to write your essays or solve all your problems is like using a forklift to lift weights at the gym. Sure, the forklift can lift heavy things easily, but <em>you</em> don't get any stronger. The whole point of lifting weights is to build <em>your own</em> muscles. Similarly, the point of doing schoolwork isn't just to get an answer or a finished product; it's to build your "mental muscles."
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    When you write an essay, for example, you're not just learning to write. You're learning much deeper skills: how to structure your thoughts, organize complex information, think critically about a topic, find evidence, and communicate your ideas clearly and persuasively. These are incredibly important skills for any job and for life in general. If AI does this heavy lifting for you, you miss out on developing these critical abilities.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    Learning can sometimes feel a bit tough or "painful" – that's when your brain is really working hard and growing. It's often at these moments that it's most tempting to let AI take over. But remember the saying, "no pain, no gain." That struggle is actually what learning feels like. If you skip that struggle, you skip the learning.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    Scientists have noticed that many teenagers today report feeling more stressed and perhaps less able to tackle difficulties. Some think this might be partly because technology, including AI, can remove many of the small challenges and hurdles that actually help us grow stronger and more resilient. Your brain is incredibly <span class="tooltip">plastic<span class="tooltiptext">Able to change and adapt as a result of experience.</span></span> (able to change and adapt) when you're young – roughly until your early twenties.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup> This is the prime time to build those fundamental thinking skills. If you rely too much on AI to do the thinking for you now, it can be much harder to develop these essential skills later in life.

                <p class="content-text">
                    So, always start with your own effort.

                    <li><strong>Engagement Optimization:</strong> AI can identify and promote content that captures attention (e.g., emotional, sensational), regardless of quality or accuracy.</li>

                    Once your attention is captured, you become more susceptible to manipulation. Misinformation and disinformation can more easily take root when you're already engaged and perhaps less critical. Your values can also be subtly shaped. For example, you might see a "cringe" video of a woman with brightly colored hair who is vegan and says something outrageous. Even if the video is designed purely to provoke anger and get views (thereby making money for the creator), repeated exposure to such content could unconsciously affect your attitude towards people with colored hair, vegans, or people holding certain political opinions. The goal of such content is often just to make you react, not to inform or engage in good faith.

                    Disadvantages can include increased distraction, impact on mental health, and spread of misleading content. For you as a vocational student, it's important to protect your focus for learning and future work.

                <p class="content-text mb-4">This AI literacy guide is designed to complement your learning with the "Skills Elektro" textbook. Many concepts and skills you're developing in English class are directly relevant to understanding and using AI responsibly. Here’s how you can make connections:</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title mt-4">General Connections (Chapter 1 Focus)</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside content-text space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Expectations & New Inventions (Ch 1, pp. 8-9):</strong> Think of AI as a new, powerful "invention that is changing the use of electricity" and many other fields. Just like past technologies transformed society, AI is doing so now. The "learning strategies and language tools" mentioned on p. 9 are exactly what you'll use to understand AI.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vocational English for AI (Ch 1, pp. 18-19):</strong> As you learn specialized vocabulary for electrical trades, recognize that understanding AI also involves learning new "vocational English" specific to AI and digital technologies (like "algorithm," "bias," "hallucination").</li>
                    <li><strong>Innovation: Edison & AI (Ch 1, pp. 40-41):</strong> Thomas Edison was a great innovator. AI is a modern-day innovation with huge transformative potential. <em>Discussion Point:</em> How is AI similar to or different from Edison's inventions in its impact on society and work?</li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside content-text space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Fictional AI vs. Real LLMs (Ch 5, "True Love", pp. 210-211):</strong> After learning that real LLMs don't "think" like humans, read the summary of Asimov's short story "True Love." <em>Writing Prompt 1.4:</em> In what ways does the AI 'Joe' in the story seem to understand or misunderstand human concepts like 'love' or 'ideal partner'? How does this compare to what you've learned about how real LLMs work?</li>
                    <li><strong>AI and Automation in Jobs (Ch 6, "Robots 'to replace up to 20 million factory jobs'", pp. 274-275):</strong> When we discuss AI enhancing human skills, this article provides context on automation. <em>Writing Prompt 1.5:</em> Read the summary of the article. Discuss how AI-driven automation might specifically impact the Elektro-field or another vocational trade you know. What 'human skills' from our list (Module 4) will be most important to complement this automation?</li>
                    <li><strong>Human-Tech Integration (Ch 6, "iBoy 101", pp. 278-279):</strong> This novel excerpt shows an extreme fictional example of human-tech fusion. <em>Discussion Starter:</em> The character in 'iBoy' literally has technology in his brain. While fictional, how does this idea relate to how integrated AI is becoming in our daily tools and devices (like smartphones)?</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex Systems Analogy (Ch 2, "The Black Box", pp. 80-81):</strong> When we say "AI is not magic," think about the complex electronic systems and data recording in aircraft, as described in "The Black Box." AI also relies on vast data and complex algorithms, similar to modern flight systems.</li>

                    <li><strong>Misinformation & Fake News (Ch 4, "Nothing on This Page is Real", pp. 138-139):</strong> This article is a perfect match! Christopher Blair's "satirical/fake news" directly relates to misinformation and how AI can generate convincing but false content. <em>Writing Prompt 2.2 (after "What is AI-Generated Fiction?" exercise):</em> Read the summary of "Nothing on This Page is Real." How does Christopher Blair's motivation for creating 'fake news' compare or contrast with how an AI might generate a 'hallucination'? What are the different dangers posed by human-created fake news versus AI-generated misinformation?</li>
                    <li><strong>Evaluating AI as a Source (Ch 4, "Skills Focus: Selecting Sources", p. 146):</strong> The principles here are <em>essential</em> for evaluating information from AI. AI is a new type of "source" needing extra scrutiny. <em>Activity Idea:</em> Review the 'Selecting Sources' guidelines. How would you adapt step 3 ('Is it relevant?'), step 4 ('Is it reliable?'), and step 5 ('Cross-check') when evaluating information from an AI like NDLA AI Chat?</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Media Impact (Ch 3, "It's a Wonderful, Digital World?", pp. 116-117):</strong> This text provides context for discussing Echo Chambers, Filter Bubbles, and the Attention Economy, as social media impact is often algorithm-driven.</li>
                    <li><strong>The "Look of Expertise" (Ch 1, "Did You Know?", p. 25):</strong> The fact that "90% of texts use only about 1000 different words" is relevant. AI can generate fluent text using common words, making it sound authoritative, even if it lacks deep understanding or is factually wrong.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key Vocabulary (Ch 4, "Useful words and phrases", p. 133):</strong> Note terms like "echo chamber," "fake news," and "manipulation" from your textbook are directly relevant here.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside content-text space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>"You First" & Learning Strategies (Ch 1, "Skills Focus: Learning Strategies", p. 16):</strong> The "You First" principle directly links to these strategies. AI can be a tool *within* these (e.g., for "Expand your vocabulary," after trying yourself, ask AI for synonyms; for "Repeat," ask AI to quiz you on material you've studied). Crucially, apply strategy 1: "Prepare your brain for learning" <em>before</em> engaging AI.</li>
                    <li><strong>Citing Sources (Not AI!) (Ch 8, "Skills Focus: Referring to Sources", p. 372):</strong> When discussing academic integrity, these principles are vital. You must cite the <em>original human-created sources</em> that AI might point you to (after you've verified them yourself). Never cite the AI as the primary source of factual information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structuring & Getting Feedback (Ch 3, "Skills Focus: Structuring Paragraphs", p. 108 & "PEED Method", p. 109):</strong> For "Getting feedback on YOUR work": After you've written a paragraph using the PEED method, you could ask an AI: 'Does this paragraph clearly state a Point, provide an Example, Explain it, and Develop the idea further? How could I improve its structure?'</li>
                    <li><strong>Formal Communication (Ch 6, "Skills Focus: Writing a Formal Text", p. 256 - Email Structure):</strong> Draft a formal email yourself, then ask AI for feedback on tone, clarity, or adherence to formal conventions, using the "Skills Elektro" guidelines as a checklist.</li>
                    <li><strong>Understanding AI Feedback (Ch 9, "Language Lab", pp. 398-430):</strong> Use the Language Lab to understand grammar or style feedback AI gives on your writing, or to self-correct *before* asking AI for help.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="subsection-title mt-6">Connections for "4. Your AI Future"</h3>

                    <li><strong>Relating to Peers (Ch 1, "Core Content: This Is Me", pp. 10-11):</strong> <em>Writing Prompt 3.2 (related to Prompt 3.1):</em> Re-read one of the student profiles in 'This Is Me'. Imagine that student (e.g., Emilie with audio-visual equipment, Joel as a power-supply fitter) is working in their field 5-10 years from now. How might AI be part of *their* daily work? What human skills would still be essential for them?</li>
                    <li><strong>Discussing AI in Your Trade (Ch 6, "Skills Focus: Discussing Vocational Topics", p. 272):</strong> This framework is excellent for class discussions about AI's role in specific trades like Electrical Engineering or Computer Technology.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI as a New Tool (Ch 5, "Tools of the Trade", p. 200):</strong> Frame AI as one of the new "Tools of the Trade." How does it compare to physical tools? What new "maintenance" (i.e., critical thinking, fact-checking) does this digital tool require?</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety, Standards & Human Responsibility (Ch 2, "Safety First!", pp. 54-55 & "Codes and Standards", pp. 76-77):</strong> When discussing "Ethical Judgment & Responsibility" as a human skill, relate it to the critical importance of safety and standards in electrical trades. AI might suggest something, but human judgment, knowledge of codes (like NEK 400), and responsibility for safety are paramount. An AI won't take responsibility for an accident.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI in Vocational Scenarios (Various "Core Content" texts):</strong> Texts like "The Rule of Three" (Ch 2, pp. 64-65 - loss of digital infrastructure), "On Call-Out" (Ch 6, pp. 250-251 - technician problem-solving), or "Spare Parts" (Ch 6, pp. 258-259 - students building ROV) can be springboards. <em>Discussion:</em> How would AI change these scenarios? What human skills shown by the characters would still be vital?</li>

                    <li><strong>Advocacy & Shaping AI (Ch 4, "Young Activists", pp. 192-193):</strong> When discussing "Your Voice Counts," these examples show how individuals can advocate for change. This can inspire you to be active in shaping ethical AI.</li>
                    <li><strong>Arguing for Responsible AI (Ch 8, "Skills Focus: Arguing a Case", p. 358):</strong> This skill is crucial for you to "Promote ethical practices" or "Join the dialogue" about AI. Use this framework to structure your arguments for responsible AI use.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI & Sustainable Development (Ch 8, "Core Text: Sustainable Development", pp. 346-347):</strong> <em>Discussion:</em> How could AI be a tool to achieve (or hinder) Sustainable Development Goals? What are the ethical implications of using AI in these contexts, especially in energy and resource management relevant to Elektro?</li>
                    <li><strong>Revisiting Digital Well-being (Ch 3, "Core Content: It's a Wonderful, Digital World?", pp. 116-117):</strong> Revisit this when discussing the "Attention Economy" and its impact on mental health and distraction.</li>
